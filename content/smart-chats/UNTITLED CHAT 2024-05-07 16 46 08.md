What is the analog of a retract from topology in linear algebra? In other words, how can one define a linear map T from a vector space V to a subspace U of V such that Tu = U for all u in U?

In linear algebra, the analog of a retract from topology is called a projection map or simply a projection. A projection map is a linear transformation that maps a vector space onto a subspace while preserving the vectors in that subspace.
Formally, let V be a vector space, and U be a subspace of V. A linear map T: V → U is called a projection onto U if it satisfies the following two conditions:
1. T(u) = u for all u in U (idempotent property)
2. Range(T) = U (T maps V onto U)
In other words, a projection map T maps every vector in the subspace U to itself, and it maps all vectors outside U onto vectors in U, such that the range of T is precisely the subspace U.
To construct a projection map T: V → U, we can use the following steps:
1. Choose a basis for the subspace U, say {u₁, u₂, ..., uₖ}.
2. Extend this basis to a basis for the entire vector space V by adding additional vectors {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ}, where n is the dimension of V.
3. For any vector x in V, express it as a linear combination of the basis vectors: x = α₁u₁ + α₂u₂ + ... + αₖuₖ + β₁v₁ + β₂v₂ + ... + βₙvₙ.
4. Define the projection map T: V → U by T(x) = α₁u₁ + α₂u₂ + ... + αₖuₖ.
This projection map T satisfies the two conditions mentioned above:
1. For any u in U, u can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors {u₁, u₂, ..., uₖ}, so T(u) = u.
2. The range of T consists of all linear combinations of {u₁, u₂, ..., uₖ}, which is precisely the subspace U.
Projection maps are widely used in linear algebra for various purposes, such as finding the closest vector in a subspace to a given vector, solving systems of linear equations, and decomposing vectors into components in different subspaces.

Can it be defined even if V and U are not necessarily finite-dimensional and thus do not have bases?

Yes, the concept of a projection map can be defined even when V and U are not necessarily finite-dimensional vector spaces and do not have bases.

In the general case, let V be a vector space (possibly infinite-dimensional) and U be a subspace of V. A linear map T: V → U is called a projection onto U if it satisfies the following two conditions:

1. T(u) = u for all u in U (idempotent property)
2. Range(T) = U (T maps V onto U)

To construct such a projection map T, we can use the following approach:

1. Define a linear functional (a linear map from V to the scalar field) f: V → F for each vector u in U, such that f(u) = 1 and f(v) = 0 for all v in the orthogonal complement U^⊥ of U (the set of all vectors in V that are orthogonal to every vector in U).

2. For any vector x in V, express it as x = u + v, where u is in U and v is in U^⊥.

3. Define the projection map T: V → U by T(x) = u.

This projection map T satisfies the two conditions:

1. For any u in U, T(u) = u, since u has no component in U^⊥.
2. The range of T consists of all vectors in U, since for any u in U, there exists an x in V (namely x = u) such that T(x) = u.

The construction of the linear functionals f relies on the existence of a basis for U and its orthogonal complement U^⊥ in the finite-dimensional case. However, in the infinite-dimensional case, we can use other techniques from functional analysis, such as the Hahn-Banach theorem, to construct these linear functionals.

This general approach shows that the concept of a projection map can be defined and constructed for any subspace U of a vector space V, even when V and U are infinite-dimensional and do not have bases.
