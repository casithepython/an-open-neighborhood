      "content": "Based on your notes, the proof provided in note #7 specifically addresses the finite complement topology and demonstrates that any infinite set with the finite complement topology is a connected space. The key aspect of this proof is the reliance on the definition of the finite complement topology, where open sets are defined as complements of finite sets in the space. This characteristic is crucial for the argument that leads to the conclusion of connectedness.\n\nThe proof goes wrong if you attempt to generalize it to any complement topology without the finiteness condition because the argument hinges on the finiteness of the complements to ensure that the union of two non-intersecting open sets (which are complements of finite sets) cannot cover the entire space unless one of the sets is empty. This is because, in an infinite set with the finite complement topology, the complement of a finite set is infinite, and the intersection of two such complements (if they were to cover the entire space) would imply a contradiction to the assumption that the original sets are non-intersecting and cover the space.\n\nIn a more general \"complement topology\" that does not restrict open sets to be complements of finite sets, the argument used in the proof for the finite complement topology does not hold. For example, if you consider open sets as complements of any subset (not necessarily finite), the topology could include open sets whose complements are infinite, and the reasoning about the impossibility of covering the space with two non-intersecting open sets falls apart.\n\nTherefore, the proof is valid within the context of finite complement topologies due to the specific properties of finiteness that are exploited in the argument. Generalizing this result to any complement topology without these finiteness constraints would indeed be invalid, as the critical properties used in the proof do not necessarily apply to more general complement topologies.",

Therefore, $d(p,r) \\leq d(p,q) + d(q,r)$ regardless of whether or not $|p_{2} - q_{2}| \\geq 1$. Similarly, the triangle inequality also holds if $p_{1} = r_{1} \\neq q_{1}$. If $p_{1} \\neq q_{1} = r_{1}$, we have $d(p,q) = d(p,r) = 1$ and $d(q,r) \\geq 0$ as previously, so $d(p,r) \\leq d(p,q) + d(q,r)$.\n\nFinally, if $p_{1} = q_{1} = r_{1}$, there are several cases. If $|p_{2} - q_{2}|, |p_{2}-r_{2}|,|q_{2}-r_{2}| \\geq 1$, we have $d(p,r) = 1 \\leq d(p,q) + d(q,r) = 1 + 1 = 2$. If $|p_{2}-q_{2}|,|p_{2}-r_{2}| \\geq 1$ but $|q_{2}-r_{2}| < 1$, then $d(p,r) = 1 \\leq d(p,q) + d(q,r) = 1 + |q_{2}-r_{2}|$.

If $|p_{2}-q_{2}|,|q_{2}-r_{2}| \\geq 1$ but $|p_{2}-r_{2}| < 1$, we have $d(p,r) = |p_{2}-r_{2}| < 1 \\leq d(p,q)+d(q,r) = 1 + 1 = 2$. If $|p_{2}-q_{2}| \\geq 1$ but $|p_{2}-r_{2}|,|q_{2}-r_{2}| < 1$, we have $d(p,r) = |p_{2}-r_{2}| < 1 \\leq d(p,q) + d(q,r) = 1 + |q_{2}-r_{2}|$.

Lastly, if $|p_{2}-r_{2}|,|p_{2}-q_{2}|,|q_{2}-r_{2}| < 1$, we have $d(p,r) = |p_{2}-r_{2}| \\leq |p_{2}-q_{2}| + |q_{2}-r_{2}| = d(p,q) + d(q,r)$ because absolute value is a metric on $\\mathbb{R}$.

This topology is also known as the cofinite topology.\n\n2. **General Complement Topology** (as you've referred to, but not a standard term): For the sake of this discussion, let's assume you mean a topology where open sets are defined as complements of arbitrary subsets, not just finite ones. This description is a bit unusual because typically, a topology can include open sets that are complements of various subsets without a specific rule like the finiteness condition in the cofinite topology. \n\nThe error in trying to generalize the proof lies in misunderstanding the properties that make the finite complement topology connected:\n\n- In the finite complement topology, any two non-empty open sets \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) must intersect. This is because if \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are open and non-empty, their complements in \\(X\\), say \\(U^c\\) and \\(V^c\\), are finite. If \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) were disjoint, \\(X = U^c \\cup V^c\\) would imply \\(X\\) is finite, which contradicts the assumption that \\(X\\) is infinite for the topology to exhibit interesting connectedness properties. Therefore, \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) must share at least one point, indicating that the space cannot be separated into two disjoint non-empty open sets, which is a definition of connectedness.\n\n- When you remove the finiteness condition, the critical reasoning above collapses. Open sets in a general topology can be complements of infinite sets, and the union of two disjoint open sets (complements of possibly infinite sets) can cover the entire space without any contradiction arising from finiteness. This means the space can potentially be separated into two disjoint non-empty open sets, which would mean the space is not connected.\n\nThe specific error in the generalized proof is assuming properties unique to the finite complement topology (namely, the impossibility of covering the space with two disjoint non-empty open sets due to the finiteness of their complements) apply to any topology defined by complements of subsets without the finiteness condition. This assumption is incorrect because the finiteness of complements is crucial for ensuring connectedness in the finite complement topology, and without this condition, the argument for connectedness does not hold."

Therefore, $d(p,r) \\leq d(p,q) + d(q,r)$ regardless of whether or not $|p_{2} - q_{2}| \\geq 1$. Similarly, the triangle inequality also holds if $p_{1} = r_{1} \\neq q_{1}$.

If $|p_{2}-q_{2}|,|q_{2}-r_{2}| \\geq 1$ but $|p_{2}-r_{2}| < 1$, we have $d(p,r) = |p_{2}-r_{2}| < 1 \\leq d(p,q)+d(q,r) = 1 + 1 = 2$. If $|p_{2}-q_{2}| \\geq 1$ but $|p_{2}-r_{2}|,|q_{2}-r_{2}| < 1$, we have $d(p,r) = |p_{2}-r_{2}| < 1 \\leq d(p,q) + d(q,r) = 1 + |q_{2}-r_{2}|$.

If $|p_{2}-r_{2}| \\geq 1$ but $|p_{2}-q_{2}|,|q_{2}-r_{2}| < 1$, we have $d(p,q) + d(q,r) \\geq d(p,r) \\geq 1 = d(p,r)$ because absolute value is a metric on $\\mathbb{R}$. Lastly, if $|p_{2}-r_{2}|,|p_{2}-q_{2}|,|q_{2}-r_{2}| < 1$, we have $d(p,r) = |p_{2}-r_{2}| \\leq |p_{2}-q_{2}| + |q_{2}-r_{2}| = d(p,q) + d(q,r)$ because absolute value is a metric on $\\mathbb{R}$.

For instance, assuming properties that only hold in specific topologies (like the real numbers with the standard topology) apply universally.\n\n2. **Logical Fallacies**: Jumping to conclusions without proper justification or assuming the converse of a true statement is also true without proof.\n\n3. **Set Operation Errors**: Misinterpreting or incorrectly applying set operations like unions, intersections, or complements. For example, concluding $U \\cap V = X$ from incorrect manipulation of set complements and unions.\n\n4. **Assuming Non-Empty Intersections**: In connectedness proofs, a common mistake is to assume without justification that certain sets must intersect, overlooking that their intersection might be empty under the given conditions.\n\n5. **Incorrect Use of Connectedness Properties**: Misunderstanding the implications of a space being connected, such as assuming that if a space is connected, then any arbitrary partition into two sets must have a non-empty intersection, which is not what connectedness means.\n\nGiven these common pitfalls, the error in a proof attempting to show that any complement topology is connected (or any similar claim) likely falls into one of these categories. If the proof incorrectly concludes that certain sets must intersect (or not intersect) based on flawed set operation logic or assumptions about the properties of the topology in question, that would be a critical point to examine.\n\nIf you can provide the exact text or a more detailed description of the specific step or line you're questioning, I could offer a more precise identification of the error."

Since all evaluations and expressions are either equalities or absolute value, both of which are symmetric, $d_{V}$ is also symmetric. Also, as $1 \\geq 0$ and $|p_{2} - q_{2}| \\geq 0$ for all $p_{2},q_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $d_{V}$ is nonnegative.\n\nFor brevity, we will write $d_{V}(p,q)$ as $d(p,q)$ in the following section.\n\nLet $p,q,r \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ with $p=(p_{1}, p_{2}), q=(q_{1}, q_{2}), r=(r_{1}, r_{2})$ for $p_{1},p_{2},q_{1},q_{2},r_{1},r_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

Therefore, $d(p,r) \\leq d(p,q) + d(q,r)$ regardless of whether or not $|p_{2} - q_{2}| \\geq 1$. Similarly, the triangle inequality also holds if $p_{1} = r_{1} \\neq q_{1}$.

If $|p_{2}-q_{2}|,|q_{2}-r_{2}| \\geq 1$ but $|p_{2}-r_{2}| < 1$, we have $d(p,r) = |p_{2}-r_{2}| < 1 \\leq d(p,q)+d(q,r) = 1 + 1 = 2$. If $|p_{2}-q_{2}| \\geq 1$ but $|p_{2}-r_{2}|,|q_{2}-r_{2}| < 1$, we have $d(p,r) = |p_{2}-r_{2}| < 1 \\leq d(p,q) + d(q,r) = 1 + |q_{2}-r_{2}|$. The same holds if  ${} |q_{2}-r_{2}| \\geq 1 {}$ but $|p_{2}-r_{2}|,|p_{2}-q_{2}| < 1$. If $|p_{2}-r_{2}| \\geq 1$ but $|p_{2}-q_{2}|,|q_{2}-r_{2}| < 1$, we have $d(p,q) + d(q,r) \\geq d(p,r) \\geq 1 = d(p,r)$ because absolute value is a metric on $\\mathbb{R}$. Lastly, if $|p_{2}-r_{2}|,|p_{2}-q_{2}|,|q_{2}-r_{2}| < 1$, we have $d(p,r) = |p_{2}-r_{2}| \\leq |p_{2}-q_{2}| + |q_{2}-r_{2}| = d(p,q) + d(q,r)$ because absolute value is a metric on $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, the triangle inequality holds for $d_V$, so $d_{V}$ is a metric.\n`QED`\n> [!thm] \n> The topology induced by $d_{V}$ is finer than but not equal to the topology induced by the standard metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. ^5eeca4\n\n`PROOF`@[[#^5eeca4]]\n\nWe let $d : \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$ be the standard metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, $T_{S}$ be the metric induced by $d$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and $T_{V}$ be the metric induced by $d_{V}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. For all $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\\epsilon>0$, we let $B_{V}(p,\\epsilon) = \\{q\\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid d_{V}(p,q) < \\epsilon\\}$, and $B(p,\\epsilon) = \\{q\\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid d(p,q) < \\epsilon\\}$. By [[Fineness with Bases#^00ceca]], we wish to first show that for every $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and every basis element $B$ in ${} T_{S} {}$ such that $p \\in B$, there exists a basis element $C$ in $T_{V}$ such that $p \\in C \\subseteq B$. \n\n Let $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Since the [[Definition of Metric Space#^65cd3c|basis elements of a metric space are open balls]], let $B(p,k)$ be a basis element in $T_{S}$ for some ${} p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2, k>0 {}$ such that $(x,y) \\in B(p,k)$. This means that $d((x,y),p) < k$, so if $j = k - d((x,y),p)$, we have $j > 0$. Then, by triangle inequality, we have ${} B((x,y),j) \\subseteq B(p,k) {}$, and clearly $(x,y) \\in B((x,y),j)$. If $j <1$, let $\\epsilon = j$, and if $j \\geq 1$, let $e \\in (0,1)$. We can see that $(x,y) \\in B((x,y),\\epsilon) \\subseteq B((x,y),j)\\subseteq B(p,k)$. Now, $\\forall (x_{2},y_{2}) \\in B_{V}((x,y),\\epsilon)$, since $\\epsilon<1$, we have $x_{2}=x$ and $|y_{2}-y| < \\epsilon$, so $d((x_{2},y_{2}),(x,y)) = \\sqrt{ (x_{2}-x)^2 + (y_{2}-y)^2 } = \\sqrt{ (y_{2}-y)^2 } = |y_{2}-y| < \\epsilon$ , meaning that $(x,y) \\in B((x,y),\\epsilon)$. Thus, $(x,y) \\in B_{V}((x,y),\\epsilon) \\subseteq B(p,k)$, so $T_{S} \\subseteq T_{V}$ by [[Fineness with Bases#^00ceca]]. \n\nHowever, for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, we have $B_{V}\\left((x,y), \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\{(a,b) \\mid (a,b) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2, a = x, |b-y| < \\frac{1}{2}\\}$. The elements of this set all share the same first value. On the other hand, for all $(p,q) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2,\\epsilon>0$, we must have $\\left( p,q \\right),\\left( p+ \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} , q\\right) \\in B((p,q),\\epsilon)$, so any basis element of the topology induced by the standard basis must contain elements of differing first values. Therefore, there cannot exist a basis element $B \\in T_{S}$ such that $(x,y) \\in B \\subseteq B_{V}\\left( (x,y), \\frac{1}{2} \\right)$, so $T_{V} \\not \\subseteq T_{S}$ and $T_{V} \\neq T_{S}$.\n`QED`\n---END #6---\n---BEGIN #7---\nTopology Class > HW 11 > Problem 3:\n> [!assumption]\n> Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space, and let ${} Y \\subseteq X {}$.

Thus, $d_{Y}$ is a metric by [[Definition of a Metric#^d80508]].\n`QED`\n\n> [!thm]\n> The topology induced by $d_{Y}$ is the same as the subspace topology on $Y$.\n\nLet $T_{S}$ be the subspace topology on $Y$, and let $T_{d}$ be the topology induced by $d_{Y}$.

Additionally, by [[Definition of Metric Space#^65cd3c]], we see that ${} \\mathcal{B}_{Y} = \\{B_{d_{Y}}(p,\\epsilon) \\mid p \\in Y, \\epsilon>0\\} {}$ is a basis for $T_{Y}$.\n\nLet $p \\in Y \\subseteq X, \\epsilon > 0$.

Also, ${} \\forall b \\in B_{d}(p,\\epsilon) \\cap Y$, $b \\in Y$ and $d(p,b) = d_{Y}(p,b) < \\epsilon$, meaning that  $b \\in B_{d_{Y}}(p,\\epsilon)$ and $B_{d}(p,\\epsilon) \\subseteq B_{d_{Y}}(p,\\epsilon)$. Thus, $B_{d}(p,\\epsilon) = B_{d_{Y}}(p,\\epsilon)$, so $\\mathcal{B}_{S} = \\mathcal{B}_{Y}$, which means that $T_{S} = T_{Y}$.\n---END #7---",
