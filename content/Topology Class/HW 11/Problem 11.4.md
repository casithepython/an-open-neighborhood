Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space, let $Y$ be a topological space, and let $f : X \mapsto Y$ be a homeomorphism. Define $d^{*} : Y \times Y \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ by $d^{*}(x, y) = d(f^{-1}(x), f^{-1}(y))$ for all $x, y, \in Y$. Show that $d^{*}$ is a metric and that the topology on $Y$ is the same as the one induced by $d_{Y}$.

Solution moved to [[Metrics invariant under homeomorphism|here]].
