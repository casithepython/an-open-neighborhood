`PROOF`@[[#^df1c5c]]
Assume $\mathbb{R}$ is disconnected, so $\exists U,V$ open such that $U \cap V = \phi$ and $U \cup V = \mathbb{R}$. We note that $\forall B \in \mathcal{B}$, $B = (a,b)$ for $a < 0 < b$, so $0 \in B$. Then, since $U$ and $V$ are both [[Definition of a Basis#^f45567|unions of basis elements]], we must have $0 \in U \cap V$. $\Longrightarrow\Longleftarrow$, so $\mathbb{R}$ is connected under this topology.
