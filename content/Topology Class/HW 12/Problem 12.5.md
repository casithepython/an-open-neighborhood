Find a topology on the the set $X = \{a, b, c\}$ such that there exists a [[Definition of Connected Subset#^c7e81f|disconnected]] subset $A \subseteq X$ but where there is no separation $U, V$ of $A$ in $X$ such that $U \cap V = \phi$.

>[!remark]
>Let $X$ have a topology $T = \{\{\},\{b\},\{a,b\},\{b,c\},\{a,b,c\}\}$. We note that as $\{a,c\} \subseteq \{a,b\} \cup \{b,c\}$, $\{a,c\} \cap \{a,b\} = \{a\} \neq \phi$, $\{a,c\} \cap \{b,c\} = \{c\} \neq \phi$, and $\{a,c\} \cap \{b,c\} \cap \{a,b\} = \phi$, $\{a,c\}$ is disconnected in $X$ by [[Definition of Connected Subset#^c7e81f]].

>Furthermore, the only pairs of open sets $U,V \in T$ such that $\{a,c\} \subseteq U \cup V$ are $\{\{a,b\},\{b,c\}\}$, $\{\{a,b\},\{a,b,c\}\}$, and $\{\{b,c\},\{a,b,c\}\}$, all of which have nonempty intersection. Thus, $\{a,c\}$ fulfills our condition.
