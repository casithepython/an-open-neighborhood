Prove that if $X$ is compact and Hausdorff, then $X$ is normal.

>[!thm] Compact and Hausdorff implies normal
>Let $X$ be a topological space. If $X$ is [[Definition of Compactness#^450466|compact]] and [[Definitions of Hausdorff, Regular, and Normal Spaces#^ffa6ea|Hausdorff]], $X$ is [[Definitions of Hausdorff, Regular, and Normal Spaces#^e6b659|normal]]. ^27

`PROOF`@[[#^27]]
Let $U,V$ be closed sets in $X$. Since $X$ is compact, $U,V$ are compact by [[Closed subset of compact set is compact#^28]]. 

Let $u \in U$. As $X$ is Hausdorff, $\forall v \in V$ there exist open sets $A_{u}, B_{v}$ such that $u \in A_{u}$, $v \in B_{v}$ and $A_{u} \cap B_{v} = \phi$. Now, 
`QED`
