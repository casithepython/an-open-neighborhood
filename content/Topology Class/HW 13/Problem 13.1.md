Let $X$ be a topological space. Prove the following:  
1. If $C_{1}, . . . , C_{n}$ are compact in $X$, then so is $\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^n Ci$.  
2. If $X$ is Hausdorff and $\{C_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A}$ is a collection of sets that are compact in $X$, then $\displaystyle\bigcap_{\alpha \in A}C_{\alpha}$ is compact in $X$.

Solution moved to [[Compactness preserved under finite union and arbitrary intersection|here]].
