> [!def] Definition of cover
> Let $X$ be a set, and let $A \subseteq X$. A collection $\mathcal{O}$ of sets in $X$ *covers* $A$ if $A \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{O}$.

>[!def] Definition of open cover
>Let $X$ be a topological space, and let $A \subseteq X$. A cover $\mathcal{O}$ of $A$ is an *open cover* if all of its elements are open in $X$.

>[!def] Definition of subcover
>Let $X$ be a set, let $A \subseteq X$, and let $\mathcal{O}$ be a cover of $A$. A collection $C \subseteq \mathcal{O}$ is a subcover of $\mathcal{O}$ if $A \subseteq \bigcup C$.

>[!def] Definition of compact space
>Let $X$ be a topological space. $X$ is *compact* if every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover.
