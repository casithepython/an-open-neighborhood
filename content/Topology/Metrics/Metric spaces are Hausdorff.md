> [!lemma] Metric spaces are Hausdorff
> Let ${} (X,d) {}$ be a metric space. $X$ is [[Definitions of Hausdorff, Regular, and Normal Spaces#^ffa6ea|Hausdorff]]. ^cea947

`PROOF`@[[Metric spaces are Hausdorff#^cea947]]
Let $a,b \in X$. Because $(X,d)$ is a [[Definition of Metric Space#^defofmetric|metric space]], $B_{d}(a,\frac{d(a,b)}{2}),B_{d}(b,\frac{d(a,b)}{2})$ are open and disjoint in $X$, and contain $a$ and $b$, respectively. Thus $X$ is Hausdorff.
`QED`
